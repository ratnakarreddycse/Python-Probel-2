# Data Anonymization Project

## Problem Description
This project generates a CSV file containing `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, and `date_of_birth` and anonymizes the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `address` columns. The solution is designed to scale to large datasets (e.g., 2GB CSV) and can be run on a laptop using Python and PySpark.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
